# What is RubyBook?

::: tip sketch
《[RubyBook](/index)》 It is a guide for small and medium-sized IT projects, aimed at helping people quickly understand the architecture, knowledge, etc. of small and medium-sized IT projects.
:::
Sunflower Scripture, the the Nine Yin Manual is a Wulin script in the novel, just like Sunflower Scripture, the the Nine Yin Manual It is a martial arts secret in the martial arts world Of course, he is not that strong, and even the second rate secret technique of Zixia Divine Skill is far behind him But most people cannot reach the level of a sect leader, even a second rate expert, so 《[RubyBook](/index)》  is enough

After years of deep cultivation in the IT industry, I gradually realized that the development of small and medium-sized projects may seem simple, but in reality, there are countless details and challenges hidden. From requirement analysis to code implementation, from toolchain building to team collaboration, every step can become the source of "pitfalls". And these experiences often require developers to repeatedly try and make mistakes in practice to accumulate.
The birth of 《[RubyBook](/index)》 originated from my thinking on "how to make small and medium-sized projects more efficient and controllable". It is not just a technical manual, but more like a "pit log" - recording typical problems, solutions, and tool recommendations I encounter in daily development. I hope to systematize fragmented experiences through this book, helping developers avoid detours and quickly grasp the development pace and core logic of small and medium-sized projects.

the target audience is：

Developers who are new to the IT industry hope to have a systematic understanding of the project development process；
Experienced developers, but lacking a comprehensive understanding of the architecture of small and medium-sized projects;
Technical managers need to build team collaboration standards or technical stacks from scratch。
There are no obscure theories inside, but rather a "problem oriented" approach, combined with real-life scenarios and code snippets, taking you step by step through the entire lifecycle of small and medium-sized projects. Whether you are an independent developer or a member of a team, 《[RubyBook](/index)》 will become your 'martial arts secret' on your desk.

Every chapter and section of 《[RubyBook](/index)》 is a condensed version of my years of experience. It may not solve all the problems you encounter, but it can provide you with a 'systematic thinking framework' - which is exactly the underlying ability that small and medium-sized projects need the most.

If you encounter confusion during development, you may want to open this book, perhaps the answer is hidden between the lines on a certain page.
